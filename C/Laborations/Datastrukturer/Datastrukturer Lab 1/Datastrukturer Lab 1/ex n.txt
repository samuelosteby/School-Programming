1) The file "Lab1 - Samuel Ã–steby.c" contains all the algorithms, data structures and code necessary to complete the exercise.

2) To test the implementations, I use various assignments asked in the lab exercise, such as using my linked lists
to add data, find the smallest number, find the biggest number and finding successors/predecessors and such.
On top of this, I also use my personal number when it comes to both adding and reading from both a stack array and a queue.

3) Use a compiler capable of handling C code. Visual Studio 2017 does this perfectly. Just add the .c file to it and compile.
All the tests are done automatically.

4) I have tested the implementation done by Hampus Tuokkola. To test it, I entered the functions he had defined into main()
and ensured that both the linked list, queue array and stack array were able to have data added to them as well as execute the
functions without any crashes or other issues. The results were as expected, it handled the functions as per the instructions.
